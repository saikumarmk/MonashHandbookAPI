    "- Prohibited unit: You've enrolled/completed in a unit that prevents you from taking the current unit. For example, MTH1030 and ENG1005 both prohibit each other. A thing to note is that you will be given the names of all the prohibited units with that, e.g enrolling in ENG1005 and MTH1030 will also tell you MTH1035 is prohibited\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have not enrolled in a unit: This one is unusual, as it only appears for 12 units. It may say to enrol in a list of units, however it really means to have done it as a prerequisite. EAE2522 is one such example\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have not completed enough units: Again, this only appears for 3 units, all of which have the prefix APG. This seems to just be a completion requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have not passed enough units: This is the normal message if you lack the prerequisites for a unit. Appears in most places.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not enough passed credit points: Some units simply require `x` credit points before you can enrol in them. Some mandate `y` credit points from faculty `z`. This appears less often but there are 360 occurences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not enough enrolled credit points: Only appears once, but seems to be similar to the above, EDF5019\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing corequisites: Corequisites are a special sort of prerequisite that can be taken either before you do a unit, or concurrently with the unit. For instance, ENG1014 has a corequisite for ENG1005.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Permission is required for this unit: You need to contact someone in order to enrol in this unit. Fairly standard."
